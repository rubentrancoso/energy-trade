# v1.3.0-cancel: Order Cancellation & Audit

## 🎯 Delivery Objective

Enable clients to cancel pending orders and ensure cancellation events are auditable and reflected consistently across all services.

## 📜 Specifications Implemented

* A new endpoint was added to cancel orders:
  * Accessible via `PATCH /orders/{id}/cancel`.
  * Only `PENDING` orders are eligible for cancellation.
  * Cancelled orders receive the `CANCELLED` status.
  * The `cancelledAt` timestamp is persisted in the order.

* Cancellation triggers:
  * An audit log entry via `audit-service`.
  * A notification event via `notification-service`.

## 📦 Feature Summary

* ➕ New: `cancelOrder()` method in `OrderController.java`
* 🔄 Updated: `Order.java` with `cancelledAt` field
* 🧪 Added: cancellation unit tests in `OrderControllerTest.java`
* 🧪 Added: simulation flow for cancellations in `IntegrationSimulator.java`

## 📁 Main Files Modified

* `order-service/src/main/java/.../OrderController.java`
* `order-service/src/main/java/.../model/Order.java`
* `integration-sim/src/.../IntegrationSimulator.java`
* `order-service/src/test/.../OrderControllerTest.java`

## 🔄 Execution Flow (Cancellation-aware)

1. Client sends `PATCH /orders/{id}/cancel`.
2. The controller:
   * Fetches the order by ID.
   * Checks if the order is `PENDING`.
   * If valid, updates the status to `CANCELLED` and sets `cancelledAt`.
3. Saves the update in `OrderRepository`.
4. Sends an audit log event (`OrderCancelledEvent`) to the `audit-service`.
5. Sends a notification to the `notification-service`.

## ✍️ Technical Details & Decisions

* Cancellation is allowed only for `PENDING` orders to preserve transactional integrity.
* A dedicated `cancelledAt` field records the time of cancellation.
* Audit and notification integrations reuse existing REST templates.
* Status transition is validated in controller logic, not at DB level.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

* Unit tests:
  * Ensure only `PENDING` orders are cancellable.
  * Verify proper status update and timestamp persistence.
* Integration simulation:
  * Order creation followed by successful cancellation.
  * Invalid cancellation attempts (non-existent or non-pending orders).

## ✅ Delivery Checklist

* [x] Add `cancelOrder` endpoint to `OrderController`
* [x] Validate business logic for `PENDING` status
* [x] Persist `CANCELLED` status and `cancelledAt` timestamp
* [x] Send audit and notification events
* [x] Extend unit test coverage
* [x] Add simulation case for cancellation
* [x] Update README and changelog
