# 📖 Chapter 1: The Turning Point — Business Rules Are Born

> 😤 "Until now, the system received orders... and that was it."

Up to version `v1.0.0-base`, our system worked as an order repository. It received HTTP requests from the simulator, stored the order in the database, logged an audit event, and that was all.

Useful? Yes. But not trading.

Now it’s time to introduce the first real market concept: **matching** — the logic that automatically matches buy and sell orders, simulating a minimalistic order book.

# 🌟 Chapter 2: Why Does the Matching Engine Come First?

The project's goal is to train advanced skills grounded in functional realism.

In any trading system, the **matching engine is the core**: it determines whether an order gets executed based on price, type, and volume.

Implementing this logic:

* Forces us to define order types (e.g., BUY / SELL)
* Requires the creation of a queue or book of open orders
* Demands a decision algorithm
* Forces us to track status changes (PENDING, EXECUTED, PARTIAL, etc.)

In other words: it kickstarts actual business modeling.

# 🛠️ Chapter 3: What Are We Implementing Exactly?

### ✨ Central Rule:

> Whenever a new order is created, the system must check if there are compatible counterpart orders (e.g., an existing SELL order compatible with a new BUY) and execute the matching automatically.

### Initial Requirements:

* Orders must have a type: BUY or SELL
* Orders must define price and volume
* Orders should remain in an open orders queue

### The system must:

* Look for compatible orders
* Execute partial or full matches
* Update volumes and statuses
* Record an audit event with execution result

# 🧩 Chapter 4: What Will Be Added or Changed?

### 1. Order Model

New fields:

* `type`: BUY | SELL
* `status`: PENDING | EXECUTED | PARTIAL | CANCELLED
* `executedVolume`
* `price`

Rule:

* BUY aims for **lowest possible** price
* SELL aims for **highest possible** price

### 2. Matching Component

Introduce a new class or internal service in `order-service`:

```java
MatchingEngine.match(Order newOrder)
```

Logic:

* Load existing orders of the **opposite** type
* Sort by price (lowest first for SELL, highest first for BUY)
* Iterate through matches, adjust volumes
* Persist all changes

### 3. Audit Events

Register entries like:

> "Order X matched with Y, volume Z, price P"

# ⚙️ Chapter 5: Technical Assumptions for First Matching

To keep the scope functional and manageable:

* All orders are **limit orders** (no market orders yet)
* Matching is **synchronized and sequential** (no concurrency handling yet)
* No rollback or compensation logic yet
* Executed orders are immutable; partial orders remain open

# 🔄 Chapter 6: The New Order Lifecycle

```
SIMULATOR → POST /orders (order-service)
          → store order in DB
          → invoke MatchingEngine
             → find counterparts
             → execute partial/full match
             → update status and volumes
          → send audit event
          → log result via Log4j2
```
