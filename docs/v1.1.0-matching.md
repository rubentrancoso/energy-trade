# v1.1.0-matching: Order Matching Engine

## 🎯 Delivery Objective

Establish the foundational logic for trade execution by implementing an order matching engine that pairs BUY and SELL requests using a price-time priority strategy.

## 📜 Specifications Implemented

* Created the `MatchingEngine` service to manage all matching logic in a single, deterministic flow.
* Matching respects:
  * **Best price wins**, followed by **first-in priority** for identical prices.
  * **Partial matching**, maintaining unfulfilled volumes as active.
  * Automatic transition of order status to `PENDING`, `PARTIAL`, or `EXECUTED`.
* Matching is automatically triggered upon each order creation.
* Audit events and notifications are generated in all match events.
* The `Order` domain object was extended with:
  * `executedVolume` to track cumulative matched volume.
  * `getRemainingVolume()` for easy status calculations.
* Orders that are already fully executed are excluded from matching.

## 📦 Feature Summary

* ➕ New: `MatchingEngine.java`
* 🔄 Updated: `OrderController.java` to invoke matching logic
* 🛠 Extended: `Order.java` with status tracking and helper methods
* 🧾 Integrated: Audit logging and notification dispatch upon match
* 🧪 Enhanced: Integration Simulator now covers edge and negative volume cases

## 📁 Main Files Modified

* `order-service/src/main/java/.../MatchingEngine.java`
* `order-service/src/main/java/.../OrderController.java`
* `order-service/src/main/java/.../model/Order.java`
* `integration-sim/src/.../IntegrationSimulator.java`
* `application.properties` (to include external service URLs)

## 🔄 Execution Flow

1. `POST /orders` receives a new order.
2. `OrderController` fetches market price from the Pricing Service.
3. The order is saved with initial status `PENDING`.
4. `MatchingEngine.match()` is triggered immediately.
   * Retrieves all eligible counterpart orders.
   * Sorts by price and timestamp.
   * Executes matches and updates all affected orders.
   * Sends audit and notification events.
5. Final state of the order (EXECUTED, PARTIAL, or PENDING) is returned.

## ✍️ Technical Details & Decisions

* Matching logic is decoupled from REST layer and lives in a dedicated class.
* `OrderStatus` stored as string for better readability and API stability.
* Audit events now use consistent JSON formatting (`Locale.US` used for decimals).
* The system explicitly skips negative volume orders at the simulation level.
* Pretty-printed JSON logging improves debuggability and onboarding.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

* Manually tested with simulated order sequences in `IntegrationSimulator`.
* New edge cases added:
  * Zero-volume orders
  * Extremely high/low price
  * Negative volume (rejected gracefully)
  * Duplicated orders
* Logs validated against expected behavior in each case.
* Visual inspection through LogCollector confirms proper message flow.

## ✅ Delivery Checklist
