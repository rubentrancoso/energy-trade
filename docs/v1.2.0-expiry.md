# v1.2.0-expiry: Order Expiration & Cleanup

## 🎯 Delivery Objective

Introduce lifecycle control over orders by enforcing expiration logic both during the matching process and through a scheduled cleanup task.

## 📜 Specifications Implemented

* Orders now contain an `expirationTimestamp` field.
* The matching engine:
  * Rejects expired incoming orders immediately.
  * Filters out expired counterpart orders before attempting matches.
  * Marks expired orders with the `EXPIRED` status and persists them.
* A scheduled cleanup component was introduced:
  * Configurable via `application.properties`.
  * Runs daily (default: 3AM) and marks all expired `PENDING`/`PARTIAL` orders as `EXPIRED`.

## 📦 Feature Summary

* ➕ New: `ScheduledExpiryCleaner.java`
* 🔄 Updated: `MatchingEngine.java` to reject and filter expired orders
* 🛠 Extended: `Order.java` with `expirationTimestamp` and `isExpired()` logic
* 🧪 Added: Expiry-related tests in `MatchingEngineTest.java`
* 🧪 Added: Expiry simulation coverage in `IntegrationSimulator.java`

## 📁 Main Files Modified

* `order-service/src/main/java/.../ScheduledExpiryCleaner.java`
* `order-service/src/main/java/.../MatchingEngine.java`
* `order-service/src/main/java/.../model/Order.java`
* `integration-sim/src/.../IntegrationSimulator.java`
* `order-service/src/test/.../MatchingEngineTest.java`
* `application.properties`

## 🔄 Execution Flow (Expiration-aware)

1. `POST /orders` is received.
2. `MatchingEngine` checks if the order is expired:
   * If yes, it's marked `EXPIRED` and saved.
3. The engine retrieves eligible counterpart orders (still valid).
4. Matching logic executes as usual on valid candidates.
5. Scheduled cleaner (`ScheduledExpiryCleaner`) runs daily:
   * Queries and marks lingering expired orders.

## ✍️ Technical Details & Decisions

* `expirationTimestamp` is non-nullable and set on order creation.
* Expired orders are excluded from match attempts (via stream filter).
* Status `EXPIRED` is added to the enum for clarity and reporting.
* All expiration logic relies on server time (`OffsetDateTime.now()`).
* Cleanup uses Spring’s `@Scheduled` with cron configured externally.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

* Extensive unit tests:
  * Expired orders ignored at matching time.
  * Status transitions to `EXPIRED` confirmed.
* Integration simulation extended:
  * Edge orders that expire before being matched.
  * Mixed valid and expired counterparts.
* Manual log inspection confirms proper behavior and event skipping.

## ✅ Delivery Checklist

* [x] Add `expirationTimestamp` to `Order`
* [x] Reject expired incoming orders during matching
* [x] Filter expired counterparts before processing
* [x] Introduce `ScheduledExpiryCleaner`
* [x] Ensure cleanup runs daily or as configured
* [x] Update README and changelog
* [x] Extend test coverage (unit + integration)
