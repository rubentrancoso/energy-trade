# v1.4.0-pricing: Market Pricing Strategy

## 🎯 Delivery Objective

Define and document the platform’s strategy for acquiring and using market prices in the trading lifecycle, establishing clear architectural guidelines for future use during order creation and matching.

## 📜 Strategic Decision & Rationale

After analyzing architectural trade-offs and comparing with industry practices in real-world trading platforms, two main approaches were identified regarding market price usage:

### 1. Market Price Captured at Order Creation (`marketPrice` field)
- ✅ This is the **most common** strategy in real-world exchanges (e.g., equities, crypto, futures)
- ✅ Avoids external service dependencies during matching
- ✅ Enables better performance, consistency, and auditability
- ❗ May lead to price deviation in highly volatile markets

### 2. Real-Time Price Lookup During Matching
- 🚫 Rarely used in high-performance matching engines
- 💡 Typically reserved for contracts with advanced conditions (e.g., slippage limits)
- ⚠ Introduces latency, risk of inconsistency, and adds operational complexity

## 🧠 Final Decision

The platform will **capture and store the market price at the moment of order creation** (`marketPrice`), and will **not call the pricing-service during the matching process**.

The stored price will be used for:
- 📉 Market impact calculations
- 📊 Reporting and audit trails
- 📺 Display to end users
- 🧾 Logging and historical tracking

The `pricing-service` remains the source of truth for market price simulation and may evolve in future versions to support:
- Live market data streaming
- Multi-asset price feeds
- Price-driven strategies and analytics

## 📦 Feature Summary

- ⚙️ No core code changes to matching or domain logic
- 📘 Architectural decision and strategic documentation delivered
- 🔗 Existing integration with `externalgw-service` maintained
