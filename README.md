# Energy Trade Simulator

Energy Trade Simulator is a modular Java project designed to simulate a simplified energy trading ecosystem using microservices, REST communication, and event-driven logging.

The project is built with **Spring Boot**, **Undertow**, and **Log4j2**, aiming to demonstrate real-world service orchestration, observability, and maintainability in a distributed architecture.

---

## 🔧 Objectives

- Simulate a realistic trading lifecycle across loosely coupled services.
- Enable real-time observability via a centralized log collector.
- Serve as a blueprint for multithreaded, resilient, and modular system design.
- Showcase code readability, testability, and configuration best practices.

---

## 📦 Stack

- **Java 11**
- **Spring Boot 2.7**
- **Undertow** (replaces default Tomcat)
- **Log4j2** (with custom HTTP appender)
- **H2** (in-memory DB)
- **Maven**
- **Windows batch scripting** (for orchestration)

---

## 🧱 Microservices Overview

- `order-service`: Handles client trade requests and order emission.
- `pricing-service`: Simulates price retrieval or external price integration.
- `audit-service`: Persists events related to transactions and system actions.
- `notification-service`: Sends external communications (e.g., email, webhook).
- `external-cotation-gw`: Acts as a stubbed external pricing API.
- `log-collector-service`: Captures and centralizes logs from all services.
- `integration-sim`: CLI-based simulation client to trigger application scenarios.

## 📡 Architecture Highlights

- Custom `HttpLogCollectorAppender` for centralized structured JSON logging
- Environment-controlled boot process with readiness detection
- Health-check loop ensures log collector starts before other services
- Structured logs enriched with service metadata (`serviceName`) for filtering

## 🚀 Current Milestone — `v1.1.0-matching`

The tag [`v1.1.0-matching`](https://github.com/rubentrancoso/energy-trade/releases/tag/v1.1.0-matching) introduces the **Order Matching Engine**, the first intelligent execution component of the platform.

This version builds on [`v1.0.0-base`](https://github.com/rubentrancoso/energy-trade/releases/tag/v1.0.0-base), adding full support for price-time matching logic, partial executions, execution status tracking, and event propagation.

### ✅ Implemented

- Automatic matching between BUY and SELL orders based on price and timestamp
- Partial and full execution logic with volume tracking
- Status transitions: `PENDING`, `PARTIAL`, `EXECUTED`
- Audit events and notifications dispatched on match
- Rejection of invalid orders (e.g. negative volume)
- Pretty-printed JSON logs for simulation and verification
- Extended simulation coverage with edge cases

## 🕘 Deprecated Milestone — `v1.0.0-base`

> ⚠️ This milestone is no longer the active baseline. It was succeeded by [`v1.1.0-matching`](#🚀-current-milestone--v110-matching).

The tag [`v1.0.0-base`](https://github.com/rubentrancoso/energy-trade/releases/tag/v1.0.0-base) marked the first stable and functional snapshot of this project.

### ✅ Implemented

- Services compile and run independently
- Structured logs are correctly emitted and collected centrally
- Logs are traceable to originating service via metadata
- Batch scripts orchestrate service startup with dependency awareness
- Orders can be created and logged using `integration-sim`
